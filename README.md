# PDFInsight
This project is a backend service that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about the content in real time. It uses FastAPI for handling API requests, WebSocket for real-time interactions, and natural language processing (NLP) with LangChain or LlamaIndex for analyzing and answering questions based on the PDF content.
